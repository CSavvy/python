Scribbler + Python + Calico
===========================
These are some sample programs written in Python to help you get started programming with the
Scribbler 2 robot and Fluke2 add-on. It goes with the free online course at csavvyedu.appspot.com

These programs are for the Simulator

Choose to draw a square, triangle, circle, and/or heart with the Simulator through a 
graphical user interface.

```
The Simulator beeps Lost Woods from Zelda.
```

snowcone.py
```

simulator_spybot.py
```
Drive the Simulator Scribbler around with a joystick and show a video stream of what 
he/she sees.
```

```
Similar to SpyBot, use the Simulator Scribbler to make a video stream, but this time 
edit the stream's colors when he/she gets close to something.
