Scribbler + Python + Calico
===========================
These are some extra programs written in Python to help you get started programming with the
Scribbler 2 robot and Fluke2 add-on. It goes with the free online course at csavvyedu.appspot.com

Try running these programs and read the code to understand what's going on. Then try to
modify them to do something else cool. Good luck!
