Scribbler + Python + Calico
===========================
These are some sample programs written in Python to help you get started programming with the
Scribbler 2 robot and Fluke2 add-on. It goes with the free online course at csavvyedu.appspot.com


draw_shapes.py
```
Done, but pick motors() or forward and rotate
```

360_gif.py
```
Scribbler spins in a circle and takes pictures, combining them into a gif file
```

SpyBot.py
```
Drive Scribbler around with a joystick and show a video stream of what Scribbler sees.
```

cupid_shuffle.py
```
Scribbler does the Cupid Shuffle.
```

diamond.py
```
Scribbler draws a diamond.
```

draw_shapes.py
```
Choose to draw a square, triangle, circle, and/or heart with Scribbler through a 
graphical user interface.
```

light_alive.py
```
Scribbler uses his/her light sensors to follow a light source.
```

light_path.py
```
Use a flashlight to tell Scribbler a series of movements to drive. It's programming 
without programming! :)
```

line_follow.py
```
Use Scribbler's line sensors to follow a line.
```

play_lost_woods.py
```
Scribbler beeps Lost Woods from Zelda.
```

snowcone.py
```
Scribbler draws a snowcone.
```

video_stream_senses.py

Similar to SpyBot, use Scribbler to make a video stream, but this time edit the stream's 
colors when Scribbler gets close to something.
