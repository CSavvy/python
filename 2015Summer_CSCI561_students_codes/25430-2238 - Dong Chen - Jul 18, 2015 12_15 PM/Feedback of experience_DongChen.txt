Feedback of experience in event and for Scribbler
       
Our group(Zhuohao Chen, Haimo Bai and me) designed four pictures: flower, small flower, tshirt and candy. The event is a very comfortable and lovely experience. There were so many cute children in this event. To show them how to use robot to draw pictures, I really feel new technology changes the world, the way of living and humans' mind.

Simulating a picture is ideal. But when getting to the real drawing , there always are some small deviations with the design. Sometimes because of the wheels of the robot, sometimes because of the paper condition. You need to control robot to stay away from the margin of paper or T-shirt. It is easy to draw straight line and nearly no errors. It is a little difficult to control the robot to draw a circle precisely.

All in all, this is a valuable experience.
