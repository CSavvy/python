Feedback of my experience

Overall speaking, it was a great experience playing with kids and showing them the robot.

The path of the robot is different from what the simulator runs, so I need to test step by step, parameter by parameter. The whole testing process was so interesting. When I saw the pattern that robot drew as my expected, it was really joyful. I used the robot drawing the outline of these patterns, and adding my personal decoration on these.

It was really fun to play with those cute kids. I prepared chocolate and all of my stickers. They liked my designs and I felt very delighted. On that day, I almost drew about 20 ice-creams.
