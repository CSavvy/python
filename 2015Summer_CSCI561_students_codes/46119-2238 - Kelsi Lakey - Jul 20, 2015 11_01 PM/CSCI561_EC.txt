Scribbler Extra Credit 

I thought that working with the scribbler robot and demonstrating it to the kids was a lot
of fun, and a great experience. Getting the robot connected at first was a little 
frustrating, but after that it was fun to learn about everything the robot
could do. I had fun designing my drawing and decorating my robot, and was a lot more 
motivated to do so because I wanted the kids to like it. 

I enjoyed interacting with the kids and telling them about how the robot moved, and how it
knew where to go. It is exciting to see kids playing and learning about robots at such a 
young age, and I am sure that it will help show them that math and science are important. 
One of the guys in my group created a button on his laptop for the kids to press to make 
the robot draw different shapes. I thought this was a great idea, and the kids really 
liked feeling as though they were making the robot move. 

Something that surprised me was how people often assume that if a robot is doing something 
it will be done the same way every time. However in the case of our robot and the 
dependence on the charge of the batteries, the shapes changed over time. Some of the 
parents were confused when we told them it might not turn out perfect, but it was fun to 
explain why.

Overall, it was very nice to get to work with an actual robot, and to get out of the 
classroom and interact with people.
