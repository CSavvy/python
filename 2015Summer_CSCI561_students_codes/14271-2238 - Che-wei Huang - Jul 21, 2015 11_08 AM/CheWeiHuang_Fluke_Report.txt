Python code for a cone:

turnLeft(1,.3)
forward(1,1)
motors(1, -0.2, 8.4)
forward(1,1)

feedback:
I had a trouble getting my Mac connected to the robot I got, 
or even my teammate's robot, while my teammate's laptop (non-Mac)
could easily getting connected to my robot.
The TA in the field told me I should upgrade my iOS to get it work...
Sadly, I had no time or enough internet bandwidth to do so.
Instead, my teammate and I took turns to use his laptop and things worked out.

I drew an ice cone for the kids, which I learned the night before
the event online. So I basically just pluged in the code and let
the robot draw on the white cloth. It was fun to see kids saying 
"wow it's amazing!" or so. 
Some of the parents even asked us if we are art major...
I really appreciate the chance to participate in the event.

In the afternoon, I enjoy the farmer's market and the shops there,
and fortunately came back in time to attend the class.
