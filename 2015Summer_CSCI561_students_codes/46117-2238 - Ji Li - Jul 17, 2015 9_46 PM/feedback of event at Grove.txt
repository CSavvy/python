This activity is amazing! Maybe our group is the most popular among the kids. They are all very interested in the ice cream cone designed by my teamate Xinran Shi. I think this experience would inspire their curiosity to science and left them a wonderful memory.
For the scribbler, I must say whether the table it ran on was horizontal made much difference to its performance. At first we just let it run on the crooked table and what it drew was totaly not the same as we did on a flat floor. So later when we were drawing features we just lift the table to make it horizontal and this really worked.
