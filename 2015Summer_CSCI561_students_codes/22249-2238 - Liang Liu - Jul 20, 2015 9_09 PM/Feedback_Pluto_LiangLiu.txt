FeedBack of PLUTO Design

The design of the Scribller program is not a difficult job. It takes me within 2 hours to learn the code
and draw the Pluto heard and five letters on a paper. To split the letters, I use the Beep() function to
make two sounds so that people can identify when to lift the pen and when to drop. Things work as expected
in Grove. I invite kids to participate in the drawing, they listen to the sound and drop the pen at proper
time. Kids are happy to participate, except some shy kids who do not want to hold the pen by them self and
those who are too young to participate. 
I find that all of us have devoted much time and design the good drawing. However, the difference between 
paper and T-shirt makes the robot's behavior unstable. My robot moves in a slow speed, so it does not slip
on T-shirt too much. I think in the future, students could be provided some guides prameters such that the 
maximum speed of robot which guarantee the wheel does not slip on T-shirts.
